//prefer not to use var because of its scoping na dfunctioning earlier version of javavscript did not have scopes functional so there was problem that is why we dont use var now 



const accountId = 144553;
let accountEmail = "kaushalsimran35@gmail.com";
var accountPassword = "Simran Kaushal";


console.table([accountId,accountEmail,accountPassword]);



fullname = "Simran kaushal";
// in javvscript there is a functionality that without writing let var or const we can just write the variabke and assign it
console.log(fullname);


let myPassword;
console.log(myPassword);
// if we left the declared variable without initialising it then its value will be undefined
