//for of loop
// suppose we have an Array
let array = [1,2,3,4,5]
for (const num  of array) {
    console.log(num);
}

// if we want to use it for any string
let greeting = "hello world";
for (const greet of greeting) {
    console.log(greet);
}
//++++++++++++++++++ So (for of) loop does all work by itself like the initialisation, the exit we just need to give the element and the object here object does not mean javavscript wala object its like any of the datatype jispe aap loop lagana chahte hain
